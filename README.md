# Production Planning for Steel Bar
Here we go through a quick summary of what was done in the project:

1. Prediction of future demand (for the upcoming 6 months) in R by applying different methods of time-series analysis
2. Developing a mathematical model for S&OP in GAMS (the model is in the .docx file)
3. Master schedule (MS) for master production schedule (MPS) besides material requirements planning (MRP) and capacity bills in MS Excel.
